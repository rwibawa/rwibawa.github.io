I found **MS-VSCode** IDE when I learned *typescript* about 7 years ago. My favorite was and still is **vi(mproved)** because it always works on any system including *windows*. However, I also needed an IDE in order to code efficiently. I should be able to debug my code in the language that I write in. Additionally, I tried *Cloud9 IDE* that is a web app running on *nodejs*. Along the way, the *Cloud9 IDE* became burdensome and **VSCode** won my heart. It's free (as in free beer), light, fast yet features-rich. Furthermore, it's very popular. Something that is rare coming from Microsoft.

It's riding its popularity with growing numbers of its extensions. I believe you can get any editor extension that you can think of. From handling any document format, *live share*, cloud client for aws, azure, google-cloud, alibaba cloud, and so on and so forth.

After all, such functionalities I use the most is the terminal for SSH, WSL, and Docker Container.

Let's click the <span style="color:green">`green corner`</span> on the lower left of **VSCode** window:
![terminal](../../assets/2022-10-06-vscode/connect-to.jpg)

Then there is a drop-down to connect to:

## Terminal for SSH
> The *bash shell* comes for free on any Unix-like OSes and MacOS X. However, on MS-Windows you better install it from [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) or [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

Select 'Open SSH Configuration File..." from the drop-down list. It's usually `$HOME/.ssh/config` file.

``` config
# Read more about SSH config files: https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config
Host lgs-docker-swarm
    HostName 13.52.49.102
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/devcluster.pem

Host rpi-zero
    HostName rpi-zero.fake.com
    User ryan
    Password password1
```

You can manage the ssh connections in this ssh configuration file. The *Password* property is optional and if it's omitted then the password will be asked later.

You can also select the remote host from the toolbar on the left most column **"Remote Explorer"**:
![remote-explorer-SSH-Targets](../../assets/2022-10-06-vscode/remote-explorer-SSH-Targets.jpg)

Once you're connected to the remote host, you can use *vscode* as a file explorer too:
![file explorer](../../assets/2022-10-06-vscode/terminal-ssh-002.jpg)

And all the extensions work on the remote host too. Here is the docker extension on the remote ssh host:
![docker extension](../../assets/2022-10-06-vscode/extension-docker.jpg)

Of course, the most important one is the remote host terminal:
![remote host terminal](../../assets/2022-10-06-vscode/terminal-ssh-003.jpg)


## Terminal for WSL
> WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on MS-Windows (currentlly: Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2019).

![wsl02](../../assets/2022-10-06-vscode/wsl02.jpg)

The same thing is for connecting to WSL. You may install several WSL2(s) in order to work with Linux natively on windows:
![remote-explorer-WSL-Targets](../../assets/2022-10-06-vscode/remote-explorer-WSL-Targets.jpg)


When you're connected to a distro, you can use *vscode* as a file explorer:
![file explorer](../../assets/2022-10-06-vscode/terminal-wsl-001.jpg)

Therefore you don't really need to run *window manager* on WSL. I'll explain on how to run X11 apps on WSL in the next post.


## Terminal for a Docker Container
Lastly is to attach to a docker container:
![attach to a docker container](../../assets/2022-10-06-vscode/attach-to-container.jpg)

You can use *vscode* as a file explorer and open a folder:
![file explorer](../../assets/2022-10-06-vscode/terminal-container-002.jpg)

Then open the terminal to work on this container:
![terminal](../../assets/2022-10-06-vscode/terminal-container-003.jpg)

> `VSCode` is my main app on MS-Windows, Mac OS X, and any Unix-like OSes.
