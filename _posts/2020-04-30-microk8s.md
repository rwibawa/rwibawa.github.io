In order to learn kubernetes, I had to install a single node kubernetes cluster on my dev machine. About 2 years ago, `minikube` was the only one available. I found out the steps to install it were not easy nor simple. Besides it doesn't have *LoadBalancer* type of service. Therefore there was no _external IP_ (of the cluster) for accessing the service. Unfortunately, the *ingress controller* didn't work either.

Luckily, a month ago I found [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/docs/). It's a `snap` to install it on my dev machine running _Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (xenial)_:

``` sh
$ sudo snap install microk8s --classic

# Add user 'ryan'
$ sudo usermod -a -G microk8s ryan
$ sudo chown -f -R ryan ~/.kube

# Check status
$ sudo microk8s.status --wait-ready

# Access it:
$ sudo microk8s.kubectl get namespaces
```

`microk8s` comes with many plugins. One of them is __metallb__ the *LoadBalancer*.
